    <h2 id="post1">First post!</h2>
    <h6>Posted on January 27, 2026</h6>
    <p>Today I started my blog! I'm excited to document my journey into programming. I learned a little about HTML and CSS, and I'm ready to try more projects.</p>

    <p>One of the first things I made was a simple web page, and now I’m working on making it look nicer with CSS. Learning is fun!</p>

    <p>Yesterday I experimented with styling text. I changed font families, added colors, and adjusted line height. It really improves readability and makes my blog look more polished.</p>

    <p>Next, I plan to add more entries and maybe even images to make the blog more interesting. Step by step, I'm learning a lot about web development!</p>
